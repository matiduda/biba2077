## How to add sound

> **Browser version** of BIBA 2077 does not support sound at this moment. For the best experience it is recommended to build the game from GitHub source files!

The game is missing additional sound effects and music. You can download it <a href="https://bayfiles.com/j87bJ0lbye/sound_rar">using this link</a>. Simply unzip the archive content to the corresponding folders in `src/main/resources/sound`.
